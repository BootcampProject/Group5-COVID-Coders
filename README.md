## User Story
* AS A traveler
  * I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities

## Acceptance Criteria

* WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
  * THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
* WHEN I view the UV index
  * THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
* WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
  * THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
* WHEN I click on a city in the search history
